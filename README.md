### NodeSchool Functional JavaScript

Solved in CoffeeScript, but included compiled JavaScript files in repo. I definetly didn't solve all of these on my own. Google answers for some of them and then tried to understand by working backwards. Guess I've got a lot to learn about JavaScript!

Just flexing my skills to get in shape for real world challenges.
